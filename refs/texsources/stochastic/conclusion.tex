The above exposition provides a full treatment of the stochastic interpolant method, as well as a careful consideration of its relation to existing literature. 
%
Our goal is to provide a general framework that can be used to devise generative models built upon dynamical transport of measure. 
%
To this end, we have detailed mathematical theory and efficient algorithms for constructing both deterministic and stochastic generative models that map between two densities exactly in finite time. 
%
Along the way, we have illustrated the various design parameters that can be used to shape this process, with connections, for example, to optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges.
%
While we detail specific instantiations, such as the mirror and one-sided interpolants, we highlight that there is a much broader space of possible designs that may be relevant for future applications.
%
Several candidate application domains include the solution of inverse problems such as image inpainting and super-resolution, spatiotemporal forecasting of dynamical systems, and scientific problems such as sampling of molecular configurations and machine learning-assisted Markov chain Monte-Carlo.
